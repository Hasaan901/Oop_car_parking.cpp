# Car Parking Management System

## Introduction

The Car Parking Management System is a C++-based console application designed to simulate the operations of a small parking lot using object-oriented programming principles. This project was developed as part of an academic assignment to demonstrate the practical application of key data structures such as stacks, queues, and linked lists.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to manage the inflow and outflow of cars in a parking facility with limited space, efficiently handling scenarios like entry queue overflow and full parking floors. The system aims to allocate parking slots dynamically and ensure no data is lost, even during congestion.

## Features

- **Entry Queue**: A circular queue holds cars waiting to be parked.
- **Parking Floors**: Two parking floors represented by stack structures simulate LIFO parking behavior.
- **Overflow Waitlist**: When both floors and the entry queue are full, a singly linked list stores car numbers that are waiting for a slot.
- **Dynamic Parking Records**: The `ParkingDetails` class dynamically maintains a list of each car's parked floor and position.
- **User Menu**: Interactive console menu allows users to enqueue cars, park them, remove parked cars, and display the current status.

## Technical Details

- **Language**: C++
- **Data Structures**:
  - **Stack**: Used for each parking floor.
  - **Circular Queue**: Manages car entry queue.
  - **Singly Linked List**: Handles the overflow waitlist.
  - **Dynamic Array**: Stores real-time parking data.
- **Functions**:
  - `enqueue()`, `dequeue()` for managing the entry queue.
  - `push()`, `pop()` for parking and removing cars from floors.
  - `addToWaitlist()`, `removeFromWaitlist()` for overflow handling.

## Compilation and Execution

To compile and run the project:

```bash
g++ car_parking.cpp -o car_parking
./car_parking
